# nodejs-simple-web-server
This is an example of a mix of an asynchronous call (reading a file and displaying its content in the browser's window) and synchronous code (going through a loop) in a simple Node.js web server. The asynchronous part executes after a delay to demonstrate the non-blocking nature of Node.js I/O requests.
